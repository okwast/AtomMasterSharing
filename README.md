# AtomMasterSharing

This is an Atom plugin using the MasterSharing System for distributed group programming.

The system allows you to share a document with friends and colleagues for collaborative work.

### Usage

Only open an empty document and perform the atom-master-sharing:startSharing command either by searching for the command in the command palette, clicking on it in the menu (Packages -> Atom Master Sharing -> StartSharing) or with the shortcut 'ctrl-alt-p'.

If you would like to change the standard port or color, just open the settings of the plugin an change them before usage.
Therefore open the settings view of Atom, go to the packages tab, search for Atom Master Sharing and click on settings.


## Note
This uses the MasterSharingCore modules, which is in an early state of development and should not yet be used in a productive environment.
